### Class Notes

- Write sway2 & xpln2 (maybe not xpln2)
- Sklearn discretizer, clustering, rule based
- Top is "upper bound", how close can we get to it
- Canâ€™t compare directly to table, the = and != are results of cliffDelta & bootstrap

### Improve Sway and Xpln

- Diff evaluation function 
  - Domination predicates
  - Boolean domination
  - Run sway once and then again with a "seed"
  - Use good way to prune the rules and select a subset
- Diff hyperparameters
- Cluster differently
  - sklearn
  - DBScan
- Dimensionality reduction - scikits opticsClustering, dbscan, bruterforce
  - Sway is analogous to PCA
- Alternative to Zitzlers
  - Tchebycheff, approach on penalty based methods
  - MOEM/D
